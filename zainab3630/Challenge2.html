            <p >There are so many, too many perhaps, things that my mom has taught me throughout my childhood that make
                me eternally grateful to her. It’s really a lifelong list of lessons and on top of this list is how she
                introduced me to books since I was a few months old.</p>

            <br>

            <p >She would tell me stories from her big imagination, which I proudly inherited, and I would refuse to
                sleep without one. This, telling me or reading a story every night, had a major effect on both my
                speaking skills and writing skills, which I developed before I could even write. I would make up a story
                and my mom would write it down. Then, of course, I got older and started writing for myself.</p>

            <br>

            <p >My mom LOVED the stories I wrote. But, when I got to 5th grade I had found different hobbies and didn’t
                enjoy writing as much as I used to, so I stopped. This upset my mom so she constantly reminded me to
                write. At that age, I would do the opposite of whatever someone would tell me. Yup, I stopped for good
                and, I hated reading books</p>

            <br>

            <p >First year of middle school, I got back to reading and I still remember how I spent three days reading a
                book and feeling absolutely lost in it. This reminded me of why I loved reading in the first place. It
                was my escape from reality.
                Since then, I have got back to reading, but unfortunately I couldn’t get back to writing.
                I still have the imagination to come up with great stories, but I lost my writing skills.</p>

            <br>

            <p >Eventually, I developed a beautiful relationship with books. I loved/ love all kinds of books but
                there’re definitely some genres I enjoy more than others. No matter where I’m going, I will always have
                a book with me.</p>
