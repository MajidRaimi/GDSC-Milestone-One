    <h2 style="color: grey;"> <pre>
        totoro is giant, friendly forest spirit. He spends most of his time sleeping - just like me - in a 
        in tree. He doesn speak, instead communicating by loud bellows that, it seems, only the totoro 
        and the cat bus can understand. He is ftom a ghibli movie. Totoro is the other side of me. </pre>
